# Scapes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bearjaw/scapes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bearjaw/scapes)

Small project that exports a personal playlist from iTunes / Apple Music as a song.link playlist.

## Why?

Not everyone uses the same music streaming services. If you use Apple Music you can simply use this app to transform your personal curated playlists into a shareable format.

Scapes creates song.link links. Song.link offers a link to the most common music streaming services.
